Sure, here are some more detailed examples of what you can build to understand Kubernetes:

### 1. Deploying a Simple Web Application
- Build a Docker image for a simple web application
- Create a Kubernetes Deployment manifest to deploy the application with a specified number of replicas
- Create a Kubernetes Service manifest to expose the application within the cluster
- Test the application by accessing it via the Service's ClusterIP

### 2. Scaling the Web Application
- Update the Deployment manifest to increase the number of replicas
- Observe the behavior of the Kubernetes scheduler as it deploys new replicas
- Use the Kubernetes dashboard or CLI to view the status of the Deployment and its replicas

### 3. Updating the Web Application
- Build a new Docker image with updated code or configuration
- Update the Deployment manifest to use the new image version
- Observe the Kubernetes rollout process as it updates the Deployment replicas to the new image
- Test the updated application by accessing it via the Service's ClusterIP

### 4. Rolling Back the Web Application
- Update the Deployment manifest to use a previous image version
- Use the Kubernetes rollout commands to trigger a rollback to the previous version
- Observe the Kubernetes rollout process as it updates the Deployment replicas to the previous image
- Test the rolled-back application by accessing it via the Service's ClusterIP

### 5. Creating a Multi-Tier Application
- Build Docker images for a frontend web application, backend API, and database
- Create Kubernetes Deployment manifests for each component, specifying labels and selectors for inter-component communication
- Create Kubernetes Service manifests for each component to expose them within the cluster
- Use the Kubernetes dashboard or CLI to view the status of the Deployments and their replicas

### 6. Configuring Ingress and Network Policies
- Create a Kubernetes Ingress manifest to expose the frontend service to the outside world
- Configure a Kubernetes NetworkPolicy manifest to restrict traffic between the frontend and backend services
- Test the application's connectivity by accessing it via the Ingress's external IP address

### 7. Using Persistent Volumes
- Create a Kubernetes PersistentVolume manifest to provision a storage volume on a local or remote disk
- Create a Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaim manifest to request a storage volume with a specific size and access mode
- Modify the Deployment manifest to use the PersistentVolumeClaim for data storage
- Test the application's data persistence by deleting and recreating the Deployment and observing that data is retained

### 8. Monitoring and Logging
- Deploy a Prometheus server and Grafana dashboard to monitor Kubernetes metrics and application performance
- Deploy an Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK) stack to collect and analyze Kubernetes logs
Use the dashboards and logs to diagnose issues and optimize application performance

### 9. Autoscaling and Load Balancing
- Configure Kubernetes HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) manifests to scale the number of replicas based on CPU or custom metrics
- Deploy a Kubernetes LoadBalancer Service manifest to distribute incoming traffic to multiple replicas
- Test the application's scalability by generating load and observing that new replicas are automatically deployed

### 10. Advanced Concepts
- Configure a Kubernetes cluster with multiple master nodes for high availability
- Implement Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) and namespaces to isolate and secure different applications and teams
- Create custom resource definitions (CRDs) to extend Kubernetes with custom objects and APIs
- Create Kubernetes Operators to automate application deployment and management, using tools like Operator SDK and KUDO.
